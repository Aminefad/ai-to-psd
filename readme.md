## System Requirements

Should work with Adobe Illustrator CS6 and later.   
The script has been tested on Illustrator CS6 (Windows 7), Illustrator CC 2017-2020 (Windows, Mac OS).

## How to run script

#### Variant 1 ‚Äî Install 

1. [Download archive] and unzip. All scripts are in the folder `jsx`
2. Place `Ai2Psd.jsx` in the Illustrator Scripts folder:
	- OS X: `/Applications/Adobe Illustrator [vers.]/Presets.localized/en_GB/Scripts`
	- Windows (32 bit): `C:\Program Files (x86)\Adobe\Adobe Illustrator [vers.]\Presets\en_GB\Scripts\`
	- Windows (64 bit): `C:\Program Files\Adobe\Adobe Illustrator [vers.] (64 Bit)\Presets\en_GB\Scripts\`
3. Restart Illustrator

[Download archive]: https://github.com/creold/ai-to-psd/archive/master.zip

#### Variant 2 ‚Äî Drag & Drop
Drag and drop the script file (JS or JSX) into Adobe Illustrator window

#### Variant 3 ‚Äî Use extension
I recommend the [Scripshon Trees] panel. In it you can specify which folder your script files are stored in.

## Document Optimization
### Strokes
If you want to save the vector stroke in the PSD, then you have to select the object and use `Object ‚Üí Path ‚Üí Outline Stroke`.

### Similar paths
If you have a large group of small objects, e.g. hair brush draws, fur or outlined text, it'd be better for the to combine such elements into the Compound Path with `Object ‚Üí Compound Path ‚Üí Make` before the script is executed.

## How to use Ai2Psd
1. Open document in Adobe Illustrator
2. Choose `File ‚Üí Scripts ‚Üí Ai2Psd`
3. Wait for the message of completion
4. Export the file to PSD via `File ‚Üí Export ‚Üí Export As...`

### Note
Meshes, objects with a gradient fill or Spot color, pattern, various strokes can't be left as vectors after the export, but they will be separate raster layers in the PSD file.
